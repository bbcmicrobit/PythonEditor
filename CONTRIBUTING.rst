Contributing to the Editor
==========================

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve the editor.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
age, gender, religion, race or sexuality. Good quality code and engagement
with respect, humour and intelligence wins every time.

We expect contributors to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of
Conduct: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.

Checklist
+++++++++

* Your code should be commented in *plain English* (British spelling).
* If your contribution is for a major block of work and you've not done so
  already, add yourself to the AUTHORS file following the convention found
  therein.
* Try to include tests!
* Have fun!
