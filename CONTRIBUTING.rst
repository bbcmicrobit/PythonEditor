Contributing to the Editor
==========================

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve the browser based editor for
MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit.

Contributions are welcome, without prejudice, from *anyone* irrespective of
who you are. If you're thinking, "but that probably doesn't mean me", then we
ESPECIALLY mean you. Good quality code and engagement with respect, humour and
intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky groups, get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved - *your fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, just people. Get involved!
* We are interested in educational, social and technical problems. If you are too, get involved.
* This is a new community. *No-one knows what they are doing*, so, get involved.

We expect contributors to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of
Conduct: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.

Finally, contributions are subject to the following caveat: the contribution
was created by the contributor who, by submitting the contribution, is
confirming that they have the authority to submit the contribution and place it
under the license as defined in the LICENSE file found within this repository.
