    <h2 id="Editor"> The Editor</h2>
      <p>The Python editor is perfect for those who want to push their coding skills further. A selection of snippets and a range of pre-made images and music give you a helping hand with your code. The editor is powered by the global <a href="http://python.org/community/microbit/">Python Community</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="Menu">Menu</h3>
    <p>The main menu of the editor contains various buttons that allow you to interact with the editor and the micro:bit device.
        If you have additional features enabled in the editor, for example WebUSB you may see extra buttons availble in this menu.
    </p>

    <p><img src="static/img/header.png" class="image img-responsive center-block"
        alt="A picture of the buttons along the top of the editor."/></p>

    <p>As well as using a mouse, you can use the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to navigate through the options and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate them. If you're in the text window, The <kbd>ESC</kbd> key will re-focus on the menu.

    <p>The name and description for your script is shown on the top
    right hand side. Click them to edit them.</p>

    <h3 id="text-window">Text window</h3>
    <p>The other part of the editor is the text window, where we edit our scripts.</p>

        class="image img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="A picture of the text area in the code editor."/></p>

    <p>The editor tries to help out by colouring the text to show what
    all the different parts of  program are. For example, Python keywords
    (words built into the Python language) are grey. The brighter coloured
    words are bits of the program <em>you</em> have created. Brown words
    are constant values that never change and purple words represent
    strings of characters to display. All the lines are numbered with the
    current line highlighted.</p>

    <h4 id="autocomplete">Autocomplete</h4>

    <p>Autocomplete gives you suggestions for your Python code as you type, giving you more of an understanding of what features are available to you and helping you to create working programs.</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/autocomplete-1.gif" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Autocomplete gives suggestions as you type."/></p>

    <p>Press the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key on your keyboard to automatically complete the current line:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/autocomplete-2.gif" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Press TAB to complete the line."/></p>

    <p>It's important to note that autocomplete isn't aware of your import statements, so you'll still need to check that your code is correct before flashing it to your device. Remember that typing <code>import microbit</code> means you should then use <code>microbit.display.scroll</code>, whereas <code>from microbit import display</code> allows you to write <code>display.scroll</code>. You can learn more about what this means <a href="https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000080153-what-is-the-difference-between-import-microbit-and-from-microbit-import-">by reading this support article</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="hello">Hello, World!</h2>
    <p>A 'Hello, World!' program is traditionally used as a quick test to see if we've got 
    our software or hardware configured correctly.</p>
    <p><img src="static/img/comic3.png" class="image img-responsive center-block"
        alt="http://goo.gl/zpfrsY"/></p>

    <p>Here's how we do this in the Python editor:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">from microbit import *


display.scroll("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

    <p>The first line (<code>from microbit import *</code>) tells <a href="#micropython">MicroPython</a>
    to get all the bits of Python needed to program the micro:bit.</p>

    <p>The second line (<code>display.scroll("Hello, World!")</code>) tells
    MicroPython to use one of those bits of Python (the <code>display</code>
    module) to scroll the text, <kbd>"Hello, World!"</kbd> across the physical
    display on the front of the device.</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/scroll-hello.gif" class="image img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation of 'hello world' scrolling over the display."/></p>

    <p>When you load the Python editor in your browser, this is the default script you will see,
        asking the micro:bit to scroll the words across the LED screen and then display an image of a heart.</p>
    <p>Why not try making the micro:bit scroll your name?</p>
   
    <div class="hide-blocks">
    <h2 id="blockly">Blockly</h2>

    <p>Use blockly to make new Python code from easy to assemble blocks of
    code.</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/blocks.png"
        class="image img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation demonstrating how to use snippets."/></p>

    <p>Blockly updates Python in the code editor as you move blocks around.
    There are lots of different blocks to cover all the features of the
    micro:bit. You can make more advanced code by combining blocks together
    (such as in the example above).</p>

    <p>You should use Blockly to create <em>new code</em> since moving blocks
    around will overwrite any existing code you have in the editor (and you may
    lose work as a result). The arrangement of blocks isn't (currently)
    saved, so Blockly makes a great way to make simple Python code without
    lots of typing. In the end, you'll learn that simply typing Python is by
    far the quickest and easiest way to write code.</p>

    <p>Not all the features of the micro:bit or MicroPython are available via
    Blockly. We've done this on purpose. Some of the more advanced and
    interesting stuff is only available in pure Python.</p>

    <p>However, by using Blockly you'll very quickly get the hang of how Python
    code works and fits together.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hide-snippets">
    <h2 id="snippets">Snippets</h2>

    <p>Snippets are a cool way to avoid typing. The animation below shows you
    how to use them:</p>

    <p><img src="static/img/snippet_example.gif"
        class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded"
        alt="An animation demonstrating how to use snippets."/></p>

    <p>You can access snippets from the "Snippets" button (see above), but
    it's a lot quicker and easier to learn the <em>triggers</em> for the
    different fragments of code, hit the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to expand the
    snippet and then fill in the remaining blocks of code so it does what you
    want.</p>

    <p class="hide-blocks">When blockly is enabled the "Snippets" button is disabled. This avoids
    snippets from interfering with code that blockly may be generating.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="bugs">Bug Fixes</h2>

    <p>Things will go wrong!</p>

    <p>You have to imagine Python is the most strict language teacher in the
    universe... yes, even more strict than that really strict one you have at
     school. Put simply, <strong>you have to type Python without any
    mistakes</strong> for it to work.</p>

    <p>All programmers make mistakes and create bugs. It's a fact of life.
    When you have a bug MicroPython tries to help you out: it will scroll a
    message on its display. It may even include a line number.</p>

    <p>Common bugs include <em>Syntax Errors</em> (which means you've typed it in
    wrong) and <em>Name Errors</em> (that mean you've typed in correct Python, but
    it can't work out what you're coding about).</p>

    <p>If you're unsure what to do
    <a href="https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">go read the
    MicroPython docs</a> or <a href="https://support.microbit.org/en/support/tickets/new">open a support request with the micro:bit team</a>.

    <p>The version of Python that runs on the BBC micro:bit is called
    MicroPython. It's exactly like <em>real</em> Python except it's designed
    to run on small devices like the BBC micro:bit. You can find out more about it
    on the <a href="http://micropython.org/">MicroPython site</a> and by reading the <a href="https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">MicroPython for micro:bit reference</a>.</p>

    <h3>How the editor works</h3>
    <p>To see how the editor actually works? It's easy, to view
        the "source code" press CTRL-U (or CMD-U on a Mac). There's a secret
        message for you in the code. Can you find it?</p>
    <p>The code for the editor lives in a <a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor">repository on Github</a>. Github
    makes it easy to raise a bug report and contribute to the project. For example, <a href="https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/PythonEditor/blob/master/help.html">here's the HTML code for this help page</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>Python makes it simple to write powerful programs. Can you work out what
    this program does?</p>

    <pre><code class="python"># Press button A for a fortune cookie.
from microbit import *
import random


fortunes = [
    "Never step off a moving bus",
    "This sentence is false",
    "The meaning of life is overrated",
    "Do not touch!",
    "You will receive some advice",
    "My hovercraft is full of eels",
    ]


while True:
    if button_a.is_pressed():
        cookie = random.choice(fortunes)
        display.scroll(cookie)</code></pre>

    <p>How could you improve it? What changes could you make?</p>
